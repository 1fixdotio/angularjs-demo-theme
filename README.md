## My Tutorials On Building Themes With AngularJS and WP REST API

1. [Using AngularJS and JSON API in Your WordPress Theme](https://1fix.io/blog/2014/11/05/angularjs-json-api-wp-theme/): An introduction to using the WP REST API and AngularJS in a WordPress theme. I wrote it based on a tutorial video from [WordPress.tv – Eric Wolfe: Building a WordPress Theme Using AngularJS](http://wordpress.tv/2014/06/16/eric-w-building-a-wordpress-theme-using-angularjs/), but added my own flavors. This post is now listed on [Resources section at WP-API.org](http://wp-api.org/resources.html), which might lead some of you to this repository.

2. [AngularJS WordPress Theme: Display Post Content with ngBindHtml](https://1fix.io/blog/2014/11/13/angularjs-wordpress-theme-ngbindhtml/): You might be wondering why AngularJS displayed post content with HTML tags but not rendered them. In this tutorial you'll find the answer and learn two approaches to solve it.

3. [Use AngularJS Custom Directives In A WordPress Theme](https://1fix.io/blog/2014/12/28/angularjs-wordpress-custom-directives/): **Custom directives** are very powerful in AngularJS. I'll show you how to create a search form directive `<search-form>` in this theme, and make it work like the WordPress built-in template tag `get_search_form()`.

4. [Minification Errors in My AngularJS WordPress Theme](https://1fix.io/blog/2015/01/02/minification-errors-angularjs-wordpress/): After minifying AngularJS scripts, our theme suddenly stopped working. How did that happen? We'll dig into another important concept called **Dependency Injection (DI)** in AngularJS.

5. [Using Slug To Get Single Post In AngularJS WordPress Theme](https://1fix.io/blog/2015/02/06/slug-angularjs-wordpress-theme/): Everyone knows pretty links bring pretty SEO performance, so we shall add post slug to our permalink structure, right? I'll get you all set in this short post.

6. [Making WordPress Admin Bar Work With AngularJS Theme](https://1fix.io/blog/2015/02/07/wordpress-admin-bar-angularjs-theme/): Oops, the WordPress admin bar dosen't work with our AngularJS theme. Let's see what we can do to fix it.

7. [Setting Page Title Dynamically In AngularJS WordPress Theme](https://1fix.io/blog/2015/02/08/set-page-title-angularjs-wordpress-theme/): Changing the page title dynamically is an important feature in our AngularJS WordPress Theme. We need to incorporate this feature into our theme.

8. [Filtering image_send_to_editor To Add Target Attribute To Link](https://1fix.io/blog/2015/02/26/add-link-target/): If you insert an image link in the post content, it will work funny (not as expected) in our AngularJS theme. With a very short snippet, boom! The problem goes away.

9. [Category Pages In AngularJS WordPress Theme](https://1fix.io/blog/2015/03/12/category-pages-angularjs-wordpress-theme/): Show me some category pages in this AngularJS WordPress theme, you said? Sure. I covered pretty much everything you need to know about this topic.

10. [Adding Slick Carousel To Your AngularJS WordPress Theme](https://1fix.io/blog/2015/03/22/angular-slick-wordpress/): Adding a slick carousel to your post to display all attached media can't be easier with [Angular Slick](https://github.com/vasyabigi/angular-slick).

11. [Pagination In AngularJS WordPress Theme](https://1fix.io/blog/2015/04/12/pagination-angularjs-wordpress-theme/): My second tutorials on creating **custom directives** in AngularJS WordPress Theme. This time we'll create a `postsNavLink` directive which works like the built-in WordPress template tag `posts_nav_link()`. They even take the same parameters!

**More content to go. Stay tuned.**
