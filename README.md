1. [Using AngularJS and JSON API in Your WordPress Theme](https://1fix.io/blog/2014/11/05/angularjs-json-api-wp-theme/): An introduction to use the WP REST API and AngularJS in a WordPress theme. I wrote it based on a tutorial video from [WordPress.tv – Eric Wolfe: Building a WordPress Theme Using AngularJS](http://wordpress.tv/2014/06/16/eric-w-building-a-wordpress-theme-using-angularjs/), but added my own flavors. This post is now listed on [Resources section at WP-API.org](http://wp-api.org/resources.html), which might lead some of you to this repository.

2. [AngularJS WordPress Theme: Display Post Content with ngBindHtml](https://1fix.io/blog/2014/11/13/angularjs-wordpress-theme-ngbindhtml/): You might be wondering why AngularJS displayed post content with HTML tags but not rendered them.

4. [Minification Errors in My AngularJS WordPress Theme](https://1fix.io/blog/2015/01/02/minification-errors-angularjs-wordpress/): After minifying AngularJS scripts, our theme suddenly stopped working.

[Pagination In AngularJS WordPress Theme](https://1fix.io/blog/2015/04/12/pagination-angularjs-wordpress-theme/): My second tutorials on creating **custom directives** in AngularJS WordPress Theme. This time we'll create a `postsNavLink` directive which works like the built-in WordPress template tag `posts_nav_link()`. They even take the same parameters!
